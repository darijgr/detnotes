# Notes on the combinatorial fundamentals of algebra

This is a set of notes originally written for a PRIMES 2015
reading project (but extended since). In its current version, it
provides a detailed introduction to permutations and determinants
(from a combinatorial viewpoint -- no linear algebra is presumed),
as well as some basic material on binomial coefficients and
recurrent sequences.
It contains about 80 exercises with solutions, and a few exercises
without.

Up-to-date PDF files can be downloaded from my website:

- [Full version (with solutions)](http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/primes2015/sols.pdf).

- [Version without solutions](http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/primes2015/probs.pdf).
(Use this if you want to solve the problems on your own and prefer not to see
spoilers.)

These notes also appear on the arXiv: [arXiv:2008.09862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09862).
However, they won't likely be updated frequently on the
arXiv.
